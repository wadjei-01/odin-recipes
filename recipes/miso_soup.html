    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our version of miso noodle soup in a jar was inspired by recipes on TikTok for miso soup in a jar. Try this
        heat-and-eat recipe for a warming main to prep and tote all season long. Use jars labeled “microwave-safe”
        (check the bottoms) and never microwave the lids.</p>

                Step 1:
            </strong> Cut tofu into 1/2-inch planks. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tofu,
            turning halfway through, until golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Cut tofu into cubes.

                Step 2:
            </strong> Stir together green onions, miso paste, garlic, stock base, and ginger in a small bowl. Divide
            evenly among 3 microwave-safe pint-size canning jars with lids.
