    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cranberry sauce recipe uses fresh cranberries, sugar, and orange juice to make a Thanksgiving classic.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Fresh Cranberries:</strong> Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free.
            Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker
            consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs
            liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Orange Juice:</strong> All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange
            juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.
        </li>

    </ul>
